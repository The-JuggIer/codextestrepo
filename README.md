This repository contains a simple endless car driving game built with
[Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/). The player's car is rendered using a
top-down image of an Audi. Cars driving toward the player spawn roughly every
five seconds and are marked with a small "BMW" label.

## Setup

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the game

Run the following command after installing the dependencies:

```bash
python car_game.py
```

Use the left and right arrow keys to move the car. Close the window to
exit the game.
